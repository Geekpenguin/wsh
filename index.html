      <p>Config respecting, sudo-ready, distributed command execution and logging</p>
      <p>
      You can find wsh on <a href="//github.com/worr/wsh">Github</a>, or download it as a <a href="https://github.com/worr/wsh/tarball/master">tarball</a> or <a href="https://github.com/worr/wsh/zipball/master">zip archive</a>.
      </p>
      <p> wsh is configurationless, which means it honors your existing ssh and 
      sudo config files, relying on ssh and sudo for authentication. It's sudo 
      ready, unlike dsh, which means no hacks are required to move sudo credentials 
      over the network. And wsh logs everything to syslog, making issue diagnosis pain free.</p>
      <p>
      wsh isn't a configuration manament tool, a shell, an ssh 
      replacment, or your next lover.
      </p>

      <p> wsh is maintained by <a href="//github.com/worr">William Orr</a>, its creator.
