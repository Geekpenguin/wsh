.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
logs in to multiple hosts and executes commands on them, in parallel. It's
suitable for executing commands on large numbers of hosts and collating their
results in a format that's easy to read.
.Ss Arguments
.Bl -tag -width u
.It Fl o | -stdout
Display stdout. stdout is suppressed by default.
.It Fl -port Ar port
Use a different port for ssh. By default, 22 is used.
.It Fl u | -username Ar username
Use a different username for SSH. By default, the username of the current
user is used.
.It Fl p | -password
Prompt for the SSH password. If this argument is not provided, then
.Nm
will assume that you are using pubkeys or an agent.
.It Fl U | -sudo-username Ar username
Use sudo with the given username. If this option is not provided, it's assumed
that you're not going to use sudo.
.It Fl P | -sudo-password
Prompt for sudo password. You 
.Sy MUST
provide this option if
.Fl U
is present.
.It Fl t | -threads Ar threads
Spawn off
.Ar threads
number of threads. If this flag is not given, then
.Nm
will execute sequentially.
.It Fl h | -hosts Ar hosts
A comma separated list of hosts to ssh into.
.It Fl f | -file Ar filename
A file to read a newline delimited set of hosts from. If
.Ar filename
is executable,
.Nm
will execute the file and use the output as the list of hosts.
.It Fl r | -range Ar range_query
If
.Nm
is built with range support,
.Ar range_query
will be resolved with range
.El
.Ss Executing commands
.Pp
The remainder of the line will be executed on the remote hosts. If the command
takes arguments
.Fl -
should be provided before the command. You ought not prefix the command with
.Li sudo
if you're planning on using
.Li sudo
.
.Pp
Commands will be sent to
.Li wshd
on the remote host using a binary protocol over
.Li SSH
.
The results will be sent back to
.Nm
and output to the user. They're collated based on the output and
the exit code of the command. Normally stdout is suppressed so that it's
easier to see errors with commands.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl wshc -h localhost -- ls -l
.Pp
SSH's into localhost and runs ls -l. Won't print anything but stderr (probably
nothing).
.Pp
.Dl wshc -h app01,app02,app03,app04,app05 -o -t 5 -- uname -a
.Pp
SSH's into app01-5 with 5 threads, runs uname -a and prints stdout.

.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
.Pp
.Nm
prompts for your passwords and stores them in memory. A page of memory is
.Xr mlock 2
and the password is kept encrypted in memory. With some knowledge of the
source and some time, it is possible to fetch the password from memory and
decrypt it.
.Pp
As soon as
.Nm
is done with the password, it is scrubbed from memory with
.Xr memset_s 3
.Pp
The input buffer is directed to the
.Xr mlock 2
page of memory with
.Xr setvbuf 3
and also scrubbed with
.Xr memset_s 3
after use.
